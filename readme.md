# Refuge Systems Star Wars Extension (RSSWx)

This was created as a project to help a game master run a Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) Star Wars Edge of the Empire table top game and is being made available for others to use if they want.

This project combines the Interface and Server project into a simple easy(ish) download and use.

# Quick Setup

In a console, navigate to the application's folder.

Run `npm install` on the applications folder and navigate to the configuration folder (`./app/configuration`) and remove the ".quick.example" suffix from the files with that suffix.

Once the installation and file renaming is complete, run `node app`.

Using the quick settings, you can now go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in a browser and login as "master" with no passcode. You should not need to change the address.

Note: This requires NodeJS v10 or higher.
